Our project is a grounded action transformer that uses language models to decompose complex tasks into simple instructions. We were inspired by recent developments in action transformers and action generation, but noticed a lack of open-source options. We chose to use natural language as the medium for communicating tasks to the model. Our website is built using Node.js, Puppeteer, Express, and a vanilla frontend. We use GPT-3/OpenAI API for our prompts. We are proud of the ability for our product to work out of the box for a limited set of tasks and look forward to the potential for community-created tasks to expand the set of actions.
